# React + TypeScript + Vite

# Reviewer

### Props vs State

Props come from the parent and are read-only
State is internal and can change over time - It's managed by the component using useState

### Controlled Components

An input element that is tied to React state

### Event Handler

A function that runs when something happens

### TypeScript Events

You must tell TypeScript what kind of event is being handled (ChangeEvent, FormEvent, etc.)
